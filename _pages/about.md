Hi There, This is Narges Babadi.
I am a PhD candidate at the University of Calgary with research and industry experience in machine learning, deep learning, and trustworthy, explainable AI. Experienced in Large Vision-language models for fine-tuning, inference, and prompt engineering with expertise spanning vision, text, and tabular modalities, as well as few-shot and meta-learning (e.g., MAML) with a strong focus on explainability, adversarial robustness, anomaly detection, and reinforcement learning. Interested in AI efficiency and deploying scalable AI solutions in cloud and GPU-accelerated environments.
