**Doctoral Researcher / Data Scientist**

Mitacs – University of Calgary(Calgary, Canada)

Jan 2023 – Present

- Optimized multimodal model inference and explainability by designing efficient self-attention and pruning redundant features.
- Developed a scalable adversarial attack targeting **patch-level similarity maps** in models such as CLIP.
- Designed defense methods improving **Top-k IoU explanation stability by up to 35%** across ImageNet, COCO, Talk2Car, and Flickr30k.
- Built an **RNN-based meta-learning system** for real-time sponge attack detection (98% accuracy on CIFAR-10 & MNIST).
- Integrated LLM-based prompt engineering to improve multimodal workflow adaptability.
- Collaborated on peer-reviewed publications.
